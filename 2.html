    We partner with Code</a>.orgÂ®, a non-profit dedicated to expanding access to computer science, and increasing participation by women and underrepresented minorities. Our vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science, just like biology, chemistry or algebra.

   Code.org organizes the annual Hour of Code campaign, which has engaged 10% of all students in the world, and provides the leading curriculum for K-12 computer science in the largest school districts in the United States.
  Below is the agenda for our teacher workshops based on the code.org computer science fundamentals program.</p>
